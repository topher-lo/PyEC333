Python code for EC333 Lent term classes. Converted over from R code written by Rachael Meager (LSE).

## Project Status
- Intro to GMM (Expected completion: TBD)

Note: I am unlikely to complete the GMM notebook anytime soon as I don't really understand how GMM works, GMM in `statsmodels` is still under development, and I do not have permission to reuse the CCAPM dataset provided in EC333.

## Python Preliminaries
Check out the [quick guide](https://github.com/topher-lo/PyEC333/blob/main/PRELIMINARIES.md) on setting up Python virtual environments on your computer.

## :rocket: Getting Started
1. Clone this repository onto your local computer with Python 3 installed
2. Change into the PyEC333 directory.
3. Run the following command: `python3 -m venv ec333_env`. This command creates a new virtual environment called `ec333_env`
5. Activate the newly installed environment by running `source env/bin/activate`
6. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. This installs into `ec333_env` *all* the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file
7. Run `python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=ec333_env`
8. Run the following command to start Jupyter notebook on your browser: `jupyter notebook`
9. Run the cells in the Jupyter notebooks!

> Note: using virtual environments in Jupyter can be a bit tricky. Check out this blog [post](https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-virtual-envs/) for a step-by-step guide on the installation process.
